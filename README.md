## Description
From Smith, Bruce, "Assembly Language", p. 64. Direct multiplication using
MUL and MLA.
## Notes
08/14/2024
Creation of initial versions of README.md, makefile, .gitignore, and 
bs6c.s. The makefile will be the version on p. 74 of "Assembly Language."
I'll need to research how to .gitignore .o, and executable files in assembly
language.
